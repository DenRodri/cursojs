When im stuck i get in the zone
Concentration and intellectual patience are learned skills, just like riding a bike or throwing a ball. The brain must adapt to be able to do them. You can develop them by reading difficult texts. Pick out a fiction book that you enjoy, and use the Pomodoro Method to read the book. Pomodoro is set a timer for 25 minutes and then 5 minutes rest or doing something else, then 25 minutes of studying, like that. This is a long term effort, like going to the gym for your brain.

If it were me, I'd pick Frank Herbert's Dune series and read it every day for an hour.

In the meantime try stillness and deep breathing. Put on the video and start doing measured deep breathing as your activity. Deep breathing calms the nervous system.

The more you conquer the urge, the easier conquering it will become.
